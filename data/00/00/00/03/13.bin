I feel really bad about this, but I'm not gonna tell you that.

110
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,520
-我千辛万苦给你牵了线  -千辛万苦
- I slaved putting this deal together. - Slaved?

111
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,070
打几个电话就千辛万苦了  不是吧
Making a few calls is "slaved"? I mean, really?

112
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,240
你这是要坑我
And now you're gonna rip me off!

113
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,870
我们掠夺者不这么做事  我们有原则
We do not do that to each other. We're Ravagers. We got a code.

114
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,670
原则就是 "能抢就抢"
Yeah, and that code is "steal from everybody."

115
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,180
我从地星把你捡来的时候
When I picked you up on Terra...

116
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:26,680
"捡来"
"Picked me up."

117
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,060
我手下这些人可是想吃掉你的
these boys of mine wanted to eat you.

118
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,560
是吗
Yeah?

119
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,610
他们以前没吃过地星人肉
They ain't never tasted any Terran before.

120
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,170
我制止了他们  你活下来多亏了我
I stopped them. You're alive because of me!

121
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,530
我会找到你的  我要
I will find you, I will...

122
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,250
悬赏捉拿他
Put a bounty on him!

123
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,510
四万
Forty K.

124
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,200
-但我要捉活的  -是  船长
- But I want him back alive. - Yeah, Cap.

125
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,850
-捉活的  -你没听错
- Alive? - That's what I said.

126
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,330
你捡走他的时候我就跟你说了
I told you when you picked that kid up,

127
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,470
就该按照客户要求把他送过去
you should have delivered him like we was hired to do!

128
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,170
他不过是我们的货
He was cargo!

129
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,890
你对他一直太心软了
You have always been soft on him.

130
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,650
我看是对你太心软了
You're the only one I'm being soft on!

131
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,550
你别给我操心奎尔先生的事了
Now, don't you worry about Mr. Quill.

132
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,570
一旦把他抓回来
As soon as we get him back here,

133
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,430
我会亲手了结他
I'm gonna kill him myself.

134
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,550
我们需要操心的是
What we do need to worry about,

135
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,130

00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,400
因为我拒绝原谅你们的同族
Because I do not forgive your people

147
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,080
杀死我父亲
for taking the life of my father,

148
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,080
父亲的父亲和祖父的行为
and his father, and his father before him.

149
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,300
我们两族间持续千年的战争永不会被遗忘
A thousand years of war between us will not be forgotten!

150
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,150
你不能这样  双方政府签署了和平条约
You can't do this! Our government signed a peace treaty.

151
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,940
我们的政府没有羞耻心
My government knows no shame.

152
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,540
山达尔人还有山达尔文明都是祸害
You Xandarians and your culture are a disease.

153
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,650
你
You

154
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,380
永不可能统治山达尔
will never rule Xandar.

155
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,380
不
No.

156
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,080
我是要治愈它
I will cure it!

157
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,310
罗南
Ronan,

158
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,340
克拉斯回来了
Korath has returned.

159
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,970
主人  那人就是个贼
Master, he is a thief,

160
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,200
一个自称星爵的法外之徒
an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord.

161
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,090
但我们发现他跟一个叫
But we have discovered he has an agreement

162
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,810
"掮客"的中间人定下协议
to retrieve the Orb for an intermediary

163
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,070
拿回宇宙灵球
known as The Broker.

164
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,600
我跟灭霸保证过帮他拿回宇宙灵球
I promised Thanos I would retrieve the Orb for him.

165
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,780
那样他才帮我毁灭山达尔
Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.

166
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,230
星云  去山达尔帮我拿到宇宙灵球
Nebula, go to Xandar and get me the Orb.

167
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,420
这将是我的荣幸
It will be my honor.

168
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,190
这将是你的末路
It will be your doom.

169
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,500
要是你再次失败
If this happens again,

170
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,160
父亲可不会给你奖励
you'll be facing our father without his prize.

171
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,040
我是灭霸的女儿
I'm a daughter of Thanos.

172
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,530
和你一样
Just like you.

173
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,160
但我对山达尔更熟
But I know Xandar.

174
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,780
罗南已经命令我来...
Ronan has already decreed that I...

175
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,420
不要替我做决定
Do not speak for me.

176
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,060
你不可以失败
You will not fail.

177
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,310
我失败过吗
Have I ever?

都是一群废柴
What a bunch of losers.

186
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,490
所有人不是忙着做无聊事
All of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid,

187
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,020
就是做无用功  真令人同情
to nothing at all. Pathetic.

188
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,980
看这个人
Look at this guy!

189
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,600
还管我们叫罪犯
Can you believe they call us criminals,

190
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,110
拿那个发型吓人才是犯罪
when he's assaulting us with that haircut?

191
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,060
这是什么东西  还自以为多炫酷
What is this thing? Look how it thinks it's so cool.

192
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,360
让人帮算什么酷
It's not cool to get help!

193
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,750
有本事自己走啊  小怪兽
Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.

194
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,180
你看那边的"微笑先生"
Look at Mr. Smiles over here.

195
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,840
你老婆在哪呢  老头子
Where's your wife, old man?

196
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,460
极品老变态
What a class-A prevert.

197
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,710
是吧  格鲁特
Right, Groot?

198
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:08,920
格鲁特
Groot?

199
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,520
别喝喷泉里的水  你个白痴
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot.

200
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,130
太恶心了
That's disgusting!

201
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,530
你喝了  我刚看到了
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it.

202
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,620
为啥要说谎
Why are you lying?

203
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,430
看来我们有目标了
Looks like we got one.

204
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,840
愚蠢的人类  看看你值多少钱
Okay, humie, how bad does someone wanna find you?

205
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:32,210
四万  格鲁特  我们要变有钱人了
40,000 units? Groot, we're gonna be rich.

206
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,100
-奎尔先生  -掮客
- Mr. Quill. - Broker.

207
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,200
宇宙灵球
The Orb.

208
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,800
-任务完成  -勇度呢
- As commissioned. - Where's Yondu?

209
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,690
他本来想亲自来的  但只能送上问候
Wanted to be here. Sends his love.

210
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,800
同时让我转告
And told me to tell you,

211
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,410
你的眉毛是同行里最酷炫的
that you got the best eyebrows in the business.

212
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,680
这是什么意思
What is it?

213
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,470
我不可以透露客户和他们的要求
It's my policy never to discuss my clients, or their needs.

214
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,780
为了拿到它我可是九死一生
Yeah, well, I almost died getting it for you.

215
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,620
干你们这行就是有这样的风险
An occupational hazard, I'm sure, in your line of work.

216
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,190
一个机械脑袋怪物
Some machine-headed freak,

217
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,440
自称是什么罗南的手下
working for a dude named Ronan.

218
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,700
罗南  抱歉了  奎尔先生
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill.

219
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,860
真的很抱歉
I truly am.

220
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,680
但凡是跟罗南扯上关系的交易
But I want no part of this transaction

221
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,560
我是不会介入的
if Ronan is involved.

222
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,110
罗南是什么人
Who's Ronan?

223
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,390
一个克里的狂徒  被和平条约所激怒
A Kree fanatic, outraged by the peace treaty,

224
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,610
除非山达尔文明  我的文明被彻底清除
who will not rest until Xandarian culture, my culture,

225
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,230
否则他不会罢休的
is wiped from existence!

226
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,610
-拜托  -他这种人
- Come on. - He's someone

227
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,430
我招惹不起
whose bad side I'd rather not be on.

228
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,870
不是吧  那我就可以招惹吗
What? What about my bad side?

229
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,580
再会无期  奎尔先生
Farewell, Mr. Quill.

230
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,360
我们有约定在先的  老兄
Hey, we had a deal, Bro!

231
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,560
怎么了
What happened?

232
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,580
这家伙翻脸不认账
This guy just backed out of a deal on me.

233
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,730
我最讨厌的就是不守信用的男人
If there's one thing I hate, it's a man without integrity.

234
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,810
彼得·奎尔  大家都叫我星爵
Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.

235
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,310
看得出你是个正人君子
You have the bearing of a man of honor.

236
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,740
我也没那么好啦
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.

237
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,430
大家倒都这么说我
People say it about me, all the time,

238
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,220
不过我一般不会这么夸自己
but it's not something I would ever say about myself.

239
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,960
这就不能怪我了
This wasn't the plan.

240
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,100
把他装进袋子  把他装进袋子
Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag!

241
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,960
不  不是她  是他
No! Not her, him!

242
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,690
要分清性别啊
Learn genders, man.

243
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,950
不带咬人的
Biting? That's not fair!

244
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,040
放松
Take it easy!

245
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,780
蠢货  你该长点记性
Fool. You should have learned.

246
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,150
我从不长记性  缺点之一
I don't learn. One of my issues.

247
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:30,980
搞什...
What the...

248
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,000
别笑了  白痴  表现得专业点
Quit smiling, you idiot. You're supposed to be a professional.

249
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,910
饶了我吧
You gotta be kidding me.

250
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,570
我满足起来很容易
I live for the simple things.

251
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,050
比如想想这样会有多疼
Like how much this is gonna hurt.

252
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,150
没错  颤抖吧  凡人
Yeah. Writhe, little man.

253
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,850
还会再长出来的  你个二缺
It'll grow back, you d'ast idiot.

254
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,250
别嘤嘤了
Quit whining.

255
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,070
实验体89P13  放下武器
Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.

256
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,650
该死
Aw, crap.

257
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,570
以新星军团的名义
By the authority of the Nova Corps,

258
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,290
-你们被逮捕了  -好了  站起来
- you are under arrest... - All right. Come on up.

259
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,740
罪名是危害他人生命及破坏财产
for endangerment to life and the destruction of property.

260
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,630
这不是星王子吗
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

261
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,220
-星爵  -抱歉了爵爷
- Star-Lord. - Sorry. "Lord."

262
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,440
我之前因为小偷小摸抓过他
I picked this guy up a while back for petty theft.

263
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,880
他还有个代号呢
He's got a code name.

264
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,150
请让开
Yeah. Stay out of the way.

265
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,400
拜托  一听就是个大盗的名字啊
Come on, man. It's a... It's an outlaw name.

266
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,810
没事的  小哥
Just relax, pal.

267
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,590
有代号挺酷的  也没有很奇怪了
It's cool to have a code name. It's not that weird.

268
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,880
法西斯

应该谴责他的行为

他正在屠杀儿童
He is slaughtering children.

284
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,830
破坏家庭
Families.

285
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,120
这就是你们的事了
That is your business.

286
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,380
我现在还有其他事要忙
Now, I have other matters to attend to.

287
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,920
混蛋
Prick.

288
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,430
好消息
Well, some good news.

289
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,640
我们好像逮捕了罗南的同伙
It looks like we've apprehended one of Ronan's compatriots.

290
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,010
卡魔拉

291
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,170
经受过全身改造  训练成了杀人机器
Surgically modified and trained as a living weapon.

292
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,180
"疯狂泰坦"灭霸的养女
The adopted daughter of the Mad Titan, Thanos.

293
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,520
最近灭霸派她和星云姐妹两人去辅佐罗南
Recently, Thanos lent her and her sister Nebula out to Ronan,

294
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,280
因此我们有理由相信
which leads us to believe

295
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,840
灭霸和罗南有勾结
that Thanos and Ronan are working together.

296
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:02,320
实验体89P13  自称"火箭"
Subject 89P13. Calls itself "Rocket."

297
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,790
在低等生命体上
The result of illegal genetic

298
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,940
进行非法基因改造和机械实验的产物
and cybernetic experiments on a lower life form.

299
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,840
什么鬼东西
What the hell?

300
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,800
他们叫它"格鲁特"
They call it "Groot."

301
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,230
近来作为89P13的私人植物及打手
A humanoid plant that's been travelling recently

302
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,280
陪伴其行动的类人植物
as 89P13's personal houseplant/muscle.

303
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,040
彼得·杰森·奎尔  来自地星
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

304
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,280
自幼被勇度·尤冬塔领导的佣兵组织"掠夺者"
Raised from youth by a band of mercenaries called the Ravagers,

305
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,120
抚养成人
led by Yondu Udonta.

306
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,310
抱歉
I'm sorry.

307
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,340
我不知道这机器是怎么运作的
I didn't know how this machine worked.

308
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,590
真是一帮子混球
What a bunch of a-holes.

309
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,830
把四个都送到克林去
Transport all four to the Kyln.

310
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,790
{\an8}{\pos(40,42)}┌

316
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,040
我猜新星军团成员一般都遵纪守法
I guess most of Nova Corps wanna uphold the laws,

317
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,990
可这里这些人腐败又残忍
but these ones here, they're corrupt and cruel.

318
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,330
反正我是不用担心
But, hey, that's not my problem.

319
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,000
我待不了多久的
I ain't gonna be here long.

320
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,430
我越过22次狱  这个也不例外
I've escaped 22 prisons. This one's no different.

321
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,840
这个妞出现是算你走运
You're lucky the broad showed up,

322
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,920
不然我和格鲁特
because otherwise, me and Groot

323
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,930
现在已经拿到赏金了
would be collecting that bounty right now,

324
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,440
至于你  已经被勇度和那些掠夺者
and you'd be getting drawn and quartered

325
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,210
五马分尸了
by Yondu and those Ravagers.

326
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,340
这些年想杀我的人可太多了
I've had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years.

327
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,790
怎么可能被一棵树和一只会说话的浣熊拿下
I ain't about to be brought down by a tree and a talking raccoon.

328
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,530
等等
Hold.

329
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,360
-浣熊是什么鬼  -浣熊是什么鬼
- What's a raccoon? - "What's a raccoon?"

330
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,060
你自己就是啊  傻货
It's what you are, stupid.

331
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,120
老子是这世上独一无二的
Ain't no thing like me, except me.

332
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,550
这个宇宙灵球是《死吻》中的神秘箱子
So, this Orb has a real shiny blue suitcase,

333
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,450
《夺宝奇兵》里的约柜
Ark of the Covenant,

334
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:20,020
还是《马耳他雄鹰》里的雕像啊
Maltese Falcon sort of vibe.

335
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,730
-到底是什么  -我是格鲁特
- What is it? - I am Groot.

336
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,490
所以呢  那个宇宙灵球是什么
So what? What's the Orb?

337
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,990
我对阴险的小偷没什么好说的
I have no words for an honorless thief.

338
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,540
你还是个想灭绝别人的疯子的走狗呢
Pretty high and mighty coming from the lackey

339
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,390
真理直气壮
of a genocidal maniac.

340
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,400
对  我知道你是谁
Yeah, I know who you are.

341
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,420
大家都知道你是谁
Anyone who's anyone knows who you are.

342
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,170
对  我们知道你是谁
Yeah, we know who you are.

343
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,610
-她是谁  -我是格鲁特
- Who is she? - I am Groot.

344
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,400
你已经说过了
Yeah, you said that.

345
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:43,100
我不是来帮罗南拿回宇宙灵球的
I wasn't retrieving the Orb for Ronan.

346
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,610
我背叛了他
I was betraying him.

347
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,340
我已经私下跟第三方买家谈好了
I had an agreement to sell it to a third party.

348
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,470
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

349
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,010
你这句话说得
Well, that's just as fascinating

350
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,800
跟之前89次一样令人耳目一新
as the first 89 times you told me that.

351
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,090
这爱心树什么毛病
What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?

352
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,300
他没法像你我这样正常说话
Well, he don't know talking good like me and you.

353
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,660
所以他的词库里只有"我"
So his vocabulistics is limited to "I"

354
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,470
"是"和"格鲁特"三个词
and "am" and "Groot."

355
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,000
顺序乱了都不行
Exclusively in that order.

356
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,220
你知道吗  我的忍耐就要到极限了
I tell you what, that's gonna wear real thin, real fast.

357
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,190
给我放下
Put that away.

358
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,150
你个蓝皮怪  把那耳机摘下来
Listen to me, you big blue bastard. Take those headphones off.

359
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,600
那是我的  应该被扣押起来的
That's mine. Those belong to impound.

360
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,390
那磁带还有播放器  都是我的
That tape and that player is mine!

361
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,600
那是1973年蓝色瑞典人的
Hooked on a Feeling,

362
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,410
《迷上一种感觉》
Blue Swede, 1973.

363
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,250
那是属于我的歌
That song belongs to me!

364
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,200
-你死定了  你死定了  -凶手
- You first! You first! - Murderer!

365
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,490
老子先宰了你  卡魔拉  你死定了
Coming for you first, Gamora! You're dead!

366
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,940
你个垃圾  贱货
You're scum! You're scum!

367
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,450
我说过吧
It's like I said,

368
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,750
她名头响着呢
she's got a rep.

369
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,070
这里有好多囚犯的亲人
A lot of prisoners here have lost their families

370
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,870
都死在了罗南和他的狗腿子手下
to Ronan and his goons.

371
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,230
她最多撑一天
She'll last a day, tops.

372
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,540
杀人犯
Murderer!

373
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,160
警卫会保护她的吧
The guards will protect her, right?

374
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,060
他们只管阻止我们逃出去
They're here to stop us from getting out.

375
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,420
在里面怎么作死他们才不管
They don't care what we do to each other inside.

376
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,310
无论未来有什么大风大浪
Whatever nightmares the future holds,

377
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,550
跟我的经历比起来  也都是
are dreams compared to what's behind me.

378
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,590
瞧瞧这个新来的鲜肉
Check out the new meat.

379
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,660
我要把你浑身抹满古纳维恩液
I'm gonna slather you up in Gunavian jelly,

380
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,350
然后好好爽一发
and go to town...

381
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,870
先把话说清楚
Let's make something clear.

382
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,420
这小子的菊花是我们的
This one here is our booty!

383
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,990
你们想动他
You wanna get to him,

384
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,240
先过我们这一关
you go through us!

385
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,690
或者  说得更准确些
Or, more accurately,

386
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,480
我们先做了你
we go through you.

387
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,880
我是他们的
I'm with them.

388
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,380
我恨你们
I hate you.

389
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,720
再结实的牢房也别想保你的命
No cell's gonna protect you for long.

390
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,430
你死定了
You're dead!

391
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,390
死定了
Dead!

392
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,360
把她带到浴室去
Take her down to the showers.

393
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,930
那里血迹容易清理
It'll be easier to clean up the blood down there.

394
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,540
奎尔  你干什么去
Quill, where you going?

395
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,690
奎尔
Quill.

396
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:18,650
奎尔
Quill!

397
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,010
卡魔拉  我现在宣判你的死刑
Gamora, consider this a death sentence

398
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,970
为你对全银河系犯下的罪行偿命吧
for your crimes against the galaxy.

399
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,190
你敢
You dare?

400
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,170
你知道我是谁吧
You know who I am, yes?

401
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,510
你是德拉克斯
You're Drax.

402
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,300
毁灭者
The Destroyer.

403
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:39,650
奎尔
Quill!

404
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,510
你知道我这名号怎么来的吧
And you know why they call me this.

405
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,780
你宰过罗南手下数十个恶棍
You slayed dozens of Ronan's minions.

406
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,130
罗南杀了我妻子  奥薇特
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,

407
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,690
还有我女儿  卡玛莉亚
and my daughter, Camaria.

408
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,960
他将她们残杀致死
He slaughtered them where they stood.

409
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,090
但他却笑了
And he laughed!

410
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,130
奎尔
Quill?

411
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,440
她的命
Her life

412
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:01,080
轮不着你们来取
is not yours to take.

413
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,030
他杀了我家人
He killed my family.

414
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,710
我也要杀了他的家人
I shall kill one of his in return.

415
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,620
当然好  德拉克斯  给你  我
Of course, Drax. Here, I...

416
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,870
奎尔  你干什么
Quill! What are you doing?

417
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,980
我绝不是罗南或灭霸的家人
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.

418
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,410
我是你阻止他的唯一希望
I'm your only hope at stopping him.

419
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,390
女人  你的话对我一文不值
Woman, your words mean nothing to me!

420
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,030
-别  别别别别  -见鬼
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! - Crap.

421
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,330
如果你的目标是杀了罗南
You know, if killing Ronan is truly your sole purpose,

422
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:45,430
杀了她也没法帮你实现目标
I don't think this is the best way to go about it.

423
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,550
这贱女人不是也刺杀过你吗
Are you not the man this wench attempted to kill?

424
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,800
反正她也不是第一个
Well, I mean, she's hardly the first woman

425
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,220
想杀我的女人了
to try and do that to me.

426
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:54,850
你看  这疤是一个巨火辣的拉贾克妞弄的
Look, this is from a smoking-hot Rajak girl.

427
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,930
拿叉子戳出来的
Stabbed me with a fork.

428
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,490
她不乐意我大清早就离她而去
Didn't like me skipping out on her at sunrise.

429
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,980
这条疤是因为有个克里妞想把我的胸腔破开
I got, right here, a Kree girl tried to rip out my thorax.

430
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:01,740
我在和新星档案处
She caught me with this

431
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,960
一个瘦瘦的阿斯卡瓦里安妞
skinny little A'askavariian

432
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,950
鬼混时被她抓包了
who worked in Nova Records.

433
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:05,930
我只是想套些消息而已
I was trying to get information.

434
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,640
你见过阿斯卡瓦里安人吧
You ever see an A'askavariian?

435
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,570
她们长着触角  牙齿跟针一样
They have tentacles, and needles for teeth.

436
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:12,020
你觉得我真会看上...
If you think I'm seriously interested in that, then...

437
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,830
好吧你不在乎  但我想说的是
You don't care. But here's the point.

438
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,420
她背叛了罗南  他会来追杀她
She betrayed Ronan. He's coming back for her.

439
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,080
等他自己找过来
And when he does,

440
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,080
到时你就可以
that's when you...

441
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,970
我为什么要把手指放在他的喉咙上
Why would I put my finger on his throat?

442
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,300
啥
What?

443
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,740
这只是个手势
No, it's a symbol.

444
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,830
这个手势表示你割了他的喉咙
This is a symbol for you slicing his throat.

445
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,460
我才不想割他的喉咙
I would not slice his throat.

446
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,980
我会一刀砍了他的脑袋
I would cut his head clean off.

447
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,500
这是通用手势啊  意思是杀人
It's a general expression for you killing somebody.

448
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,110
你听说过  见过这手势  对吧
You've heard of this. You've seen this, right?

449
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,660
-你知道这什么意思吧  -知道  知道
- You know what that is. - Yeah. Yeah.

450
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,990
-人人都知道  -不知道  不知道
- Everyone knows. - No, no.

451
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,710
我就是想说  你最好留她一命
What I'm saying is, you want to keep her alive.

452
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,770
别帮你敌人的忙
Don't do his work for him.

453
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
我喜欢你的刀  我收下了
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.

454
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,160
-那是人家最喜欢的刀  -听着
- That was my favorite knife. - Listen!

455
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,400
我才懒得管你是死是活
I could care less whether you live or whether you die.

456
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,280
-那你拦下那大个子干什么  -简单
- Then why stop the big guy? - Simple.

457
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,080
你知道能把宇宙灵球卖给谁
You know where to sell my Orb.

458
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,480
我们和那东西都困在这里  你怎么卖
How are we gonna sell it when we and it are still here?

459
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,190
我这位火箭老兄
My friend Rocket, here,

460
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,640
成功越狱22次
has escaped 22 prisons.

461
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,530
我们肯定出得去
We're getting out.

462
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,480
然后我们直奔勇度那里去取你的赏金
And then we're headed straight to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

463
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,280
你那买家打算花多少钱买我的宇宙灵球
How much was your buyer willing to pay you for my Orb?

464
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,800
四十亿
Four billion units.

465
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,520
-多少  -我操
- What? - Holy shit.

466
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,480
宇宙灵球是我逃离灭霸和罗南的机会
That Orb is my opportunity to get away from Thanos and Ronan.

467
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,630
如果你能越狱
If you free us,

468
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,890
我就直接带你去见买家
I'll lead you to the buyer directly

469
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,640
卖的钱我们三个平分
and I'll split the profit between the three of us.

470
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,480
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

471
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,960
四人平分
Four of us.

472
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,170
出事儿了睡大觉  一听见钱就来精神
Asleep for the danger, awake for the money,

473
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,670
死性不改
as per frickin' usual.

474
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,640
你被背叛了  罗南
You have been betrayed, Ronan.

475
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,120
我们只知道她被捉住了
We know only that she has been captured.

476
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,970
卡魔拉也许还有机会取回宇宙灵球
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

477
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,560
错  我们在克林的线人
No! Our sources within the Kyln

478
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,880
说卡魔拉对宇宙灵球自有打算
say Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.

479
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,090
你跟灭霸的合作
Your partnership with Thanos

480
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,000
已经岌岌可危了
is at risk.

481
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,480
灭霸要见你  现在就见
Thanos requires your presence. Now!

482
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,400
恕我直言  灭霸
With all due respect, Thanos,

483
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,840
{\an8}{\pos(263,47)}┌

484
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,840
{\an8}┐

485
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,840
{\an8}{\pos(263,60)}└

486
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,840
{\an8}┘

487
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:35,090
{\an8}{\pos(276,51)}圣域

488
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:35,090
{\an8}{\pos(283,41)}灭霸领地

489
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,170
是你女儿惹下的麻烦
your daughter made this mess,

490
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,770
你却传唤我过来
and yet you summon me.

491
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,010
你最好说话小声些  指控者
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

492
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,930
她先是败在一群原始人手下
First, she lost a battle with some primitive.

493
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,760
灭霸把卡魔拉交由你调遣
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

494
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,650
然后还被新星军团送进大牢
Then she was apprehended by the Nova Corps.

495
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,690
现在空口无凭的人是你
You are the one here with nothing to show for it.

496
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,850
是你的线人说她早已谋划背叛我们
Your sources say that she meant to betray us the whole time!

497
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,160
放尊重点
Lower your tone!

498
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,360
我虽是你的
I may be your...

499
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,450
我只希望您把这当回事
I only ask that you take this matter seriously.

500
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,280
小子  我不当回事的
The only matter I do not take seriously, boy,

501
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,960
只有你了
is you.

502
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,200
你的政治权术真无聊
Your politics bore me.

503
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,490
你做事像个闹脾气的孩子
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

504
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,000
而且很显然
And, apparently,

505
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:23,470
是你逼走了我最爱的女儿  卡魔拉
you alienated my favorite daughter, Gamora.

506
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,850
我会践行我们的约定的  克里人
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

507
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,680
但你务必将宇宙灵球带给我
if you bring me the Orb.

508
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,080
如果下次见我时你再两手空空
But return to me again empty-handed,

509
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,010
我就用你的血染红整个星系
and I will bathe the starways in your blood.

510
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,800
多谢了  父亲  很公平
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

511
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,850
这场争斗你赢不了
This is one fight you won't win.

512
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,760
我们去克林吧
Let's head to the Kyln.

513
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,520
如果我们想逃出去
If we're gonna get out of here,

514
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,360
得设法进到那边的瞭望塔里
we're gonna need to get into that watchtower.

515
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,200
为此我需要几件东西
And to do that, I'm gonna need a few things.

516
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,800
警卫都佩戴着安保臂带
The guards wear security bands

517
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,320
来控制人员进出  我要一个
to control their ins and outs. I need one.

518
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,160
交给我
Leave it to me.

519
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,170
那边那位  我需要他的假腿
That dude, there. I need his prosthetic leg.

520
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,930
-他的腿  -对
- His leg? - Yeah.

521
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,320
其他的部分我可不需要
God knows I don't need the rest of him.

522
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,160
瞧瞧他  废物
Look at him, he's useless.

523
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,640
好吧
All right.

524
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,030
最后一样  后边的墙上
And finally, on the wall back there

525
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,040
有块黑色面板  闪着黄灯的
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

526
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,250
-瞧见了没  -看见了
- Do you see it? - Yeah.

527
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,430
里面有块柯尼斯电池
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.

528
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,450
紫颜色的  接着绿色电线
Purplish box, green wires.

529
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,690
要想进瞭望塔  我需要这东西
To get into that watchtower, I definitely need it.

530
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,210
要怎么才能拿到
How are we supposed to do that?

531
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,570
这群秃头佬应该觉得你挺美
Well, supposably, these bald-bodies find you attractive.

532
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,290
所以你可以色诱一个
So, maybe you can work out some sort of trade.

533
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,850
你逗乐呢吧
You must be joking.

534
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,410
没有  我真听他们说你挺美
No, I really heard they find you attractive.

535
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,130
你看  那东西离地20英尺
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

536
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,060
而且还处在
and it's in the middle of

537
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,650
一座戒备森严的监狱正中央
the most heavily-guarded part of the prison.

538
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,490
想要不被发现  绝不可能
It's impossible to get up there without being seen.

539
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,610
我想了个计划
I got one plan,

540
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,810
而这计划他妈的还就需要柯尼斯电池
and that plan requires a frickin' quarnyx battery,

541
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,970
所以你给我想办法去
so figure it out!

542
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,330
我接着说了哈  多谢
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

543
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,330
接下来这点非常重要
Now, this is important.

544
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,970
一旦电池被取下来
Once the battery is removed,

545
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,490
监狱就会进入警戒状态
everything is gonna slam into emergency mode.

546
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,290
所以一旦得手  就必须迅速行动
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,

547
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,210
因此务必在最后一步再取下电池
so you definitely need to get that last.

548
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,090
或者先拿电池  再随机应变
Or we could just get it first and improvise.

549
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,200
-我去取臂带  -我去拿腿
- I'll get the armband. - Leg.

550
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,280
囚犯
Prisoner,

551
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,240
立即放下该设备  退回监房
drop the device immediately and retreat to your cell,

552
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,370
否则我们就开火了
or we will open fire.

553
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,400
我  是
I am

554
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,290
格鲁特
Groot!

555
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,800
开火
Fire!

556
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,810
所有囚犯立即返回休息区
All prisoners return to your sleeping areas.

557
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,810
你个白痴
You idiot!

558
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,600
家伙不在手上  我怎么跟这些东西打
How am I supposed to fight these things without my stuff?

559
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,320
是那动物在指挥
The animal is in control.

560
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,520
听我命令准备开火
Fire on my command!

561
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,320
猥琐的小怪物
Creepy little beast!

562
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,960
这才像话
Yeah.

563
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,720
你想要我的啥
You need my what?

564
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,400
-把这个给我  -请便吧
- I'll need this. - Good luck.

565
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,970
这是内置在体内的
It's internally wired.

566
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,810
我自有办法
I'll figure something out.

567
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,930
把腿放下
Drop the leg!

568
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,560
把腿放下  回到自己监房去
Drop the leg and move back to your cell!

569
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,810
火箭
Rocket!

570
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,000
朝瞭望塔前进
Move to the watchtower!

571
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,000
你
You!

572
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,960
睡过阿斯卡瓦里安人的男人
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!

573
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,120
就那么一次而已
It was one time, man.

574
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,490
所有待命警卫请全副武装
We need all available guards in full combat gear...

575
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,330
不要怨恨地盯着我  女人
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

576
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,480
这家伙来干什么
Why is this one here?

577
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,920
我们答应了
We promised him he could

578
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,520
让他跟着我们  直到手刃了你老大
stay by your side until he kills your boss.

579
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,970
我向来信守承诺
I always keep my promises,

580
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,690
尤其是面对一个肌肉呆男
when they're to muscle-bound whack-jobs

581
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,360
我不同意就宰了我的时候  给你
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.

582
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,450
腿我是开玩笑的
I was just kidding about the leg.

583
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,650
我只需要这两样东西
I just need these two things.

584
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,450
-什么  -我就觉着会挺好笑啊
- What? - No, I thought it'd be funny.

585
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,560
多好笑啊
Was it funny?

586
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,450
等等  他单腿跳是个什么样子
Wait, what did he look like hopping around?

587
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,490
我可是花了三万块买的他的腿
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!

588
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,600
我们要怎么逃脱
How are we going to leave?

589
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,040
他想好计划了
Well, he's got a plan.

590
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,930
有的吧  难道也是编出来逗人玩的
Right? Or is that another thing you made up?

591
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,480
有计划的  我有计划的
I have a plan! I have a plan!

592
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,250
别再唧唧歪歪的了
Cease your yammering

593
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,970
赶紧带我们冲出这恼人的监牢吧
and relieve us from this irksome confinement.

594
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,480
这回我跟这个活字典
Yeah, I'll have to agree with the walking thesaurus

595
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,450
看法相同
on that one.

596
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,960
不准再叫我字典
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

597
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,840
就是个比喻而已  哥们
It's just a metaphor, dude.

598
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,360
他们只能理解字面意思
His people are completely literal.

599
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,890
弄个比喻就绕晕了
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

600
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,570
我怎么绕都不晕的
Nothing goes over my head.

601
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,800
我的反应特别快  肯定能走出去
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.

602
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,320
我要全银河最蠢的人死在一起了
I'm gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

603
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,850
那些枪威力可不小
Those are some big guns.

604
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,320
听我号令
On my command!

605
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,240
第一发
Number one!

606
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
耗子  你的计划呢
Rodent, we are ready for your plan.

607
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,120
急什么
Hold on!

608
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,960
第二发
Number two!

609
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,690
我认得这种动物
I recognize this animal.

610
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,010
我们小时候会拿来架在火上烤
We'd roast them over a flame pit as children.

611
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,320
肉质相当鲜美
Their flesh was quite delicious.

612
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,600
帮倒忙呢你
Not helping!

613
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
第三发
Number three!

614
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,650
全体听我号令
All fire on my command!

615
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,160
三
Three!

616
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,840
二
Two!

617
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,440
一
One!

618
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,600
他把人工重力关掉了
He turned off the artificial gravity,

619
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,720
除了这座瞭望塔里的
everywhere but in here.

620
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,320
我就说我有计划
I told you I had a plan.

621
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,280
这计划真是太完美了
That was a pretty good plan.

622
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,880
太好了  在那边  去开我的飞船
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.

623
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,970
米拉诺号  那边角落里橙蓝相间的那艘
It's the Milano, the orange and blue one over in the corner.

624
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,760
居然把我的裤子卷成一团
They crumpled my pants up into a ball.

625
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,920
真没礼貌  你们的都是叠好了的
That's rude! They folded yours.

626
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,120
宇宙灵球在里面呢  快走
The Orb's there. Let's go.

627
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,930
-等下  等下等下  -怎么了
- Wait, wait, wait. - What?

628
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,680
那混蛋没放回来
That bastard didn't put it back.

629
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,680
-什么没放回来  -拿着
- Put what back? - Here.

630
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,610
带到船上去  我随后就到
Get them to the ship. I will be right back.

631
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,750
你打算怎么
How are you gonna possibly...

632
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,290
让米拉诺号停在附近就行
Just keep the Milano close by.

633
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,600
走吧
Go.

634
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,040
快走啊
Go!

635
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,160
我的脖子
My neck!

636
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,360
他打算怎么跟我们会合
Well, how's he gonna get to us?

637
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,610
他拒绝向我透露相关信息
He declined to share that information with me.

638
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,170
那就去他的
Well, screw this, then!

639
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,610
我才不想傻等一个作死的人类
I ain't waiting around for some humie with a death wish.

640
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,920
宇宙灵球在你手上呢  是吧
You got the Orb, right?

641
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,690
对
Yes.

642
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,090
如果现在再不走  我们会被轰成渣的
If we don't leave now, we will be blown to bits.

643
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,170
不行
No!

644
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,520
宇宙灵球没到手决不能走
We're not leaving without the Orb.

645
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,170
快看
Behold.

646
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,760
你果然有胆识
This one shows spirit.

647
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,720
在和罗南对战时肯定是个得力帮手
He shall make a keen ally in the battle against Ronan.

648
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,370
朋友  你回去拿什么了
Companion, what were you retrieving?

649
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,120
真是个蠢材
You're an imbecile.

650
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,480
{\an8}{\pos(192,38)}浣熊形象的卡通人物

651
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,480
游侠瑞克  你这是在干嘛
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?

652
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,840
你怎么没经过同意就拆我的飞船
You can't take apart my ship without asking me!

653
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,890
-这是什么  -别碰那个
- See, what is this? - Don't touch that!

654
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,970
是个炸弹
It's a bomb.

655
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
-炸弹?  -对
- A bomb? - Yup.

656
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,800
你就把炸弹那样放着
And you leave it lying around?

657
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,530
我本来打算找个盒子放进去的
I was gonna put it in a box.

658
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,720
放到盒子里有用吗
What's a box gonna do?

659
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,040
-这个怎么样  -不行
- How about this one? - No! Hey!

660
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,450
-别碰  -为什么  这是什么
- Leave it alone. - Why? What is it?

661
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,770
闭嘴
Shut up.

662
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,120
那个是什么
What is that?

663
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,010
这是在万分危急时候用的
That's for if things get really hardcore.

664
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,080
或者想炸卫星时候用的
Or if you wanna blow up moons.

665
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,470
我不会让你们炸卫星
No one's blowing up moons.

666
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,520
乐趣都被你抹杀光了
You just wanna suck the joy out of everything.

667
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,800
我需要你联系的买家坐标
So, listen, I'm gonna need your buyer's coordinates.

668
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,170
暂时来说  我们的航行方向没有问题
We're heading in the right direction. For now.

669
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,250
如果你真想合作的话
If we're gonna work together,

670
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,680
至少试着多信任我点
you might try trusting me a little bit.

671
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,280
那你有多信任我
And how much do you trust me?

672
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,860
如果你告诉我这是什么
I'd trust you a lot more

673
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,450
我就能更信任你
if you told me what this was.

674
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,280
我猜这是某种武器
Because I'm guessing it's some kind of weapon.

675
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,770
我也不知道这是什么
I don't know what it is.

676
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,120
如果真是武器  那就能用来对付罗南了
If it's a weapon, we should use it against Ronan.

677
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,200
快放下  你个傻子  你会害死我们的
Put it down, you fool. You'll destroy us all.

678
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,320
只想害死你  女杀手
Or just you, murderess!

679
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,080
我可救了你一次  小娘子
I let you live once, princess!

680
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,280
我才不是娘子
I am not a princess!

681
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,000
在我的飞船上别闹出人命
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!

682
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,240
我们得团结一致拿到钱
We're stuck together until we get the money.

683
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,520
我可不是为了钱
I have no interest in money.

684
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,960
棒极了
Great.

685
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,370
那我们三个又能多分点了
That means more money for the three of us.

686
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,720
我们四个
For the four of us.

687
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,250
伙伴们
Partners.

688
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,930
我们是有约在先
We have an agreement,

689
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,000
但我绝不会做你这种人的伙伴
but I would never be partners with the likes of you.

690
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,080
我去通知买家我们在路上了
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.

691
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,440
奎尔  你的船真恶心
And Quill, your ship is filthy.

692
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,600
这才哪到哪
She has no idea.

693
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,250
用黑光灯一照
If I had a black light,

694
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,760
整艘飞船里都是我的涂鸦
the place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.

and turned into some...

835
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,280
什么小怪物
Some little monster!

836
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,360
火箭  没人叫你怪物
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.

837
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,640
他叫我爬虫
He called me "Vermin"!

838
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,400
她叫我耗子
She called me "Rodent"!

839
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,970
让我们瞧瞧
Let's see if you can laugh

840
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,040
给你脸上来个四五发  你还笑不笑得出
after five or six good shots to your frickin' face!

841
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,650
别  别  别  别
No, no, no, no!

842
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,960
四十亿啊  火箭
Four billion units! Rocket!

843
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,170
想想吧  冷静点
Come on, man. Hey!

844
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,800
忍一忍  再受一晚上的罪
Suck it up for one more lousy night

845
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,010
你就有钱了
and you're rich.

846
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,880
好吧
Fine.

847
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,800
我可不保证这事完了后
But I can't promise, when all this is over

848
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,530
我不会把你们这群混蛋全杀了
I'm not gonna kill every last one of you jerks.

849
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,200
看到没  这就是为什么你们都没朋友
See? That's exactly why none of you have any friends!

850
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,220
跟别的人才认识五秒
Five seconds after you meet somebody,

851
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,530
你就想着要杀了他们了
you're already trying to kill them!

852
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,530
我们穿过了半个星系来到这
We have travelled, halfway across the quadrant.

853
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,680
连罗南的毫毛都没伤着
And Ronan is no closer to being dead.

854
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,080
-德拉克斯  -让他去
- Drax! - Let him go.

855
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,480
我们不需要他
We don't need him.

856
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,880
卡魔拉女士
Milady Gamora.

857
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,880
我过来接你去见我主人
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

858
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,120
这里一点也不诡异
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.

859
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,400
我们的馆藏珍品在整个星系是最多的
We house the galaxy's largest collection

860
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,560
动物  遗骸  不同物种应有尽有
of fauna, relics, and species of all manner.

861
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,800
容我为你们介绍
I present to you,

862
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,600
坦利亚·蒂万  收藏者
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.

863
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,520
亲爱的卡魔拉
My dear Gamora.

864
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,720
能见到本尊真是荣幸
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

865
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,440
省掉这些繁文缛节吧  蒂万
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

866
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,400
我们有你要的东西
We have what we discussed.

867
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,920
那边那个是什么东西
What is that thing there?

868
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,800
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

869
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,530
我从来没想到能遇见个格鲁特
I never thought I'd meet a Groot.

870
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,120
先生
Sir...

871
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,590
请务必把您的尸体卖给我
You must allow me to pay you now

872
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,080
我现在就付款
so that I may own your carcass.

873
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,130
当然了  要等您死后
At the moment of your death, of course.

874
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,520
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

875
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,440
怎么  给你拿去做个椅子吗
Why, so he could turn you into a frickin' chair?

876
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,020
这是你的宠物吗
That's your pet?

877
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,530
-他的什么  -蒂万
- His what? - Tivan.

878
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,880
我们穿越大半个银河系  取来了灵球
We have been halfway around the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.

879
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,120
非常好  那么
Very well, then.

880
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,760
让我看看你们带来的东西
Let us see what you brought.

881
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,170
三块柯尼斯电池  七箱科他蒂种子
Three quarnyx batteries, seven cases of Cotati seeds.

882
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,730
不  要七箱  上次你寄过来的
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...

883
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,240
你得帮我传达个信息
You shall send a message for me.

884
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,700
我的新朋友们
My new friends.

885
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,560
在宇宙开创之前
Before creation itself,

886
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,440
一共有六个奇点
there were six singularities.

887
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,400
然后宇宙大爆炸创造了万物
Then the universe exploded into existence,

888
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,600
这六个奇点的残留物
and the remnants of these systems

889
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,200
被收集起来凝炼成宝石
were forged into concentrated ingots.

890
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,240
称作无限宝石
Infinity Stones.

891
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,890
这些宝石似乎
These stones, it seems,

892
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,880
只有拥有非凡的力量
can only be brandished

893
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,520
才能驾驭
by beings of extraordinary strength.

894
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,720
请看
Observe.

895
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:52,810
这些携带者借助宝石能摧毁整个文明
These carriers can use the Stone to mow down entire civilizations

896
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,360
跟收麦子一样易如反掌
like wheat in a field.

897
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,120
我已经快吓尿了
There's a little pee coming out of me right now.

898
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,160
曾经有那么一次
Once, for a moment,

899
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,370
一个组织成功地共同控制了这股能量
a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves,

900
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,490
但即使是他们也很快被这力量摧毁了
but even they were quickly destroyed by it.

901
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,360
太美了
Beautiful.

902
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,690
无与伦比
Beyond compare.

903
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,270
我们都沉醉其中了  白毛
We're all very fascinated, whitey.

904
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:27,780
但是快给钱
But we'd like to get paid.

905
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,760
你们希望用什么方式付款
How would you like to get paid?

906
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,510
你说呢  花花公子  当然是现金
What do you think, fancy man? Units!

907
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,520
很好
Very well, then.

908
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,480
卡瑞娜
Carina.

909
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,800
别靠近
Stand back.

910
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,120
我再也不要做你的奴隶了
I will no longer be your slave!

911
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,720
不
No!

912
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,120
我了个
What the...

913
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:47,860
我怎么会相信蒂万
How could I think Tivan

914
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:49,360
知道如何控制宇宙灵球里的东西
could contain whatever was within the Orb?

915
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,610
你还拿着是要做什么
What do you still have it for?

916
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,010
不然怎么办  留在那儿吗
What are we gonna do, leave it in there?

917
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,580
你竟然还装进自己的荷包里了
I can't believe you had that in your purse!

918
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,420
这是个背包  不是荷包
It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

919
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:59,170
我们必须把这个交给新星军团
We have to bring this to the Nova Corps.

920
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,000
他们可能知道如何控制它
There's a chance they can contain it.

921
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,280
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

922
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,800
我们正在被新星军团通缉
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.

923
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,800
把它交给罗南就是了
Just give it to Ronan!

924
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,510
然后帮他毁了整个银河系吗
So he can destroy the galaxy?

925
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:08,320
怎么了你  突然变成圣人了吗
What are you, some saint all of a sudden?

926
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,020
银河系帮过你吗
What has the galaxy ever done for you?

927
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,450
你为什么想救它
Why would you wanna save it?

928
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:13,210
因为我就生活在这里面啊
Because I'm one of the idiots who lives in it!

929
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,730
彼得  听我说
Peter, listen to me.

930
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,960
绝不能让宝石落入罗南之手
We cannot allow the Stone to fall into Ronan's hands.

931
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,720
我们现在就回你飞船
We have to go back to your ship,

932
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,370
然后送去新星
and deliver it to Nova.

933
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,920
好的  就这样  你说得对
Right, right, okay. I think you're right.

934
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,190
或者我们可以把它交给某个
Or we could give it to somebody

935
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,640
不会逮捕我们的
who's not going to arrest us,

936
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,040
大好人
who's really nice

937
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,880
然后大赚一笔
for a whole lot of money.

938
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:32,970
我觉得这是个
I think it's a really good

939
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:34,560
能两全其美的好方法
balance between both of your points of view.

940
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,720
你太卑鄙
You're despicable.

941
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,400
太无耻
Dishonorable.

942
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,040
毫无信用
Faithless!

943
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,330
-不  -终于
- No. - At last!

944
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,360
我要面对我的仇敌并且亲手解决他了
I shall meet my foe and destroy him.

945
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,240
是你叫来了罗南
You called Ronan?

946
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:56,120
奎尔  别想跑  小子
Quill! Don't you move, boy!

947
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,400
你敢跑  别挡道
Don't you move! Get out of the way!

948
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,810
指控者罗南
Ronan the Accuser!

949
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,570
是你传送的信息吗
You are the one who transmitted the message?

950
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:09,770
你杀了我妻子
You killed my wife.

951
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,520
你杀了我女儿
You killed my daughter!

952
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,760
我都说了  你进不来的
I told you, you can't fit.

953
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,800
在这儿等我回来
Now, wait here. I'll be back.

954
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,760
是卡魔拉  她带着宇宙灵球逃走了
It is Gamora. She is escaping with the Orb.

955
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,210
不
No!

956
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,320
星云
Nebula,

957
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,810
去夺回宇宙灵球
retrieve the Orb.

958
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,240
宝石在最前面那个作业舱里
The Stone is in the furthest pod.

959
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,200
击落它
Bring it down!

960
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,920
火箭  掩护卡魔拉到米拉诺号
Rocket, keep them off Gamora until she gets to the Milano.

961
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,480
怎么掩护  这上面又没有武器
How? We've got no weaponry on these things.

962
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,500
这些作业舱都是工业级的
These pods are industrial grade.

963
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,120
基本上坚不可摧
They're nearly indestructible.

964
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,390
那也吃不消死灵炮啊
Not against necroblasts, they're not.

965
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,160
我可不是那个意思
That's not what I'm saying.

966
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,320
借你飞船用一用
Let me borrow your ride.

967
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,920
我不记得杀过你家人
I don't recall killing your family.

968
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,600
大概也不会记得杀过你
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

969
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:40,080
奎尔  我被困住了  到不了米拉诺号
Quill, I'm trapped. I can't make it to the Milano.

970
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,960
只能冲去外层空间了
I have to head out.

971
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,160
等等  这些作业舱不能飞到外层空间去
Wait! These things aren't meant to go out there.

972
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,120
你太让我失望了  姐姐
You are a disappointment, sister.

973
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,800
在所有姐妹当中
Of all our siblings,

974
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,160
我最不讨厌的就是你
I hated you least.

975
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,840
星云  别这样
Nebula, please.

976
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,640
如果罗南得到了宝石
If Ronan gets this stone

977
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,800
-他会杀光我们所有人  -不是所有人
- He'll kill us all. - Not all.

978
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,200
你活不到那时候
You will already be dead.

979
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:06,760
罗南  东西到手了
Ronan, it is done.

980
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,800
奎尔  算了
Quill, come on.

981
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,840
她的身体改造过  大概能撑几分钟
Her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes,

982
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
可我们没办法救她
but there's nothing we can do for her.

983
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,720
这些作业舱在外面坚持不了多久的
These pods aren't meant to be out here.

984
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,240
很快  我们也会像她一样
In a second, we're gonna be in the same boat.

985
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,080
去他的
Aw, damn it.

986
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,840
奎尔
Quill?

987
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,760
勇度  勇度
Yondu! Yondu.

988
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,210
我是奎尔
This is Quill!

989
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,800
-我现在的坐标是227K324  -奎尔
- My coordinates are 227K324. - Quill.

990
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,200
奎尔  你在干什么
Quill, what are you doing?

991
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,810
就在无存知地外面
Just outside Knowhere.

992
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,080
如果你在的话  就来抓我吧
If you're there, come get me.

993
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,290
我随你处置
I'm all yours.

994
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,720
奎尔  别犯傻
Quill, don't be ridiculous.

995
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,440
回你的作业舱里去
Get back into your pod!

996
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,880
里面装不下两个人  你会死的
You can't fit two people in there. You're gonna die.

997
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,960
你马上就会死的
You'll die in seconds!

998
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,440
奎尔
Quill.

999
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,170
奎尔
Quill?

1000
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,330
怎么了
What happened?

1001
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,520
我看见你漂浮在外面
I saw you out there.

1002
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,400
我也不知道自己怎么了
I don't know what came over me.

1003
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,200
我不能眼睁睁让你死
But I couldn't let you die.

1004
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,440
我突然感受到了内心深处的一种
I found something inside of myself.

1005
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,050
一种
Something

1006
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,980
难以置信的英雄气概
incredibly heroic.

1007
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,440
我不是在夸自己
I mean, not to brag,

1008
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,920
可是  客观地说
but, objectively...

1009
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,040
宇宙灵球呢
Where's the Orb?

1010
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,120
他们把宇宙灵球抢走了
It's... Well, they got the Orb.

1011
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,320
什么
What?

1012
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,520
欢迎回家  彼得
Welcome home, Peter.

1013
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,160
蠢货  全是无可救药的蠢货
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!

1014
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,760
奎尔竟然自投罗网了
Quill just got himself captured.

1015
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,560
要不是你
None of this ever would have

1016
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,200
一意孤行  非要去单挑罗南
happened if you didn't try to single-handedly

1017
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,600
这一切都不会发生
take on a frickin' army!

1018
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:31,600
你说得没错
You're right.

1019
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,400
我是个傻瓜
I was a fool.

1020
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,560
所有的愤怒
All the anger,

1021
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,040
所有的怨气
all the rage,

1022
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,520
都是为了掩饰我的伤痛
was just to cover my loss.

1023
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:59,440
"我的老婆孩子都死了"
Boo-hoo-hoo. "My wife and child are dead."

1024
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,200
我才不在乎这有多残忍
I don't care if it's mean!

1025
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,240
谁家没死过人
Everybody's got dead people.

1026
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,570
不代表你就有理由让大家
It's no excuse to get everybody else

1027
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,640
陪你一起送死
dead along the way!

1028
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,120
好了  格鲁特  罗南拿到了宝石
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.

1029
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:17,400
我们现在唯一能做的
The only chance we got

1030
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,610
就是赶紧飞往宇宙另一头去
is to get to the other side of the universe

1031
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,520
越快越好
as fast as we can and maybe,

1032
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,300
也许趁着那神经病还没打过来
just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives

1033
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,320
能安稳的过一辈子
before that whack-job ever gets there.

1034
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,160
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1035
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,600
救他们  怎么救
Save them? How?

1036
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,520
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1037
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,420
我知道他们是我们唯一的朋友
I know they're the only friends that we ever had,

1038
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:41,170
可他们现在落在掠夺者军队手里
but there's an army of Ravagers around them.

1039
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,970
我们只有两个人
And there's only two of us!

1040
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,240
是三个
Three.

1041
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,560
我都被你们气得
You're making me

1042
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,290
只能  拿草
beat...up

1043
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,480
撒气了
grass!

1044
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,720
宇宙灵球已经在我手里了
The Orb is in my possession,

1045
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,360
我说到做到
as I promised.

1046
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,040
把它送到我这里来
Bring it to me.

1047
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:11,520
没错  这是我们之前约定好的
Yes, that was our agreement.

1048
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,930
我帮你拿来宇宙灵球
Bring you the Orb,

1049
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:17,640
你帮我毁灭山达尔
and you will destroy Xandar for me.

1050
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:22,360
不过  既然我知道了它装有无限宝石
However, now that I know it contains an Infinity Stone,

1051
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,520
我很好奇我还要你做什么
I wonder what use I have for you.

1052
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,200
小子
Boy,

1053
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,110
你最好给我想清楚了
I would reconsider your current course.

1054
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,360
主人  你不能这么做
Master! You cannot!

1055
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,040
灭霸是这宇宙中最强大的存在
Thanos is the most powerful being in the universe.

1056
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,330
不再是了
Not anymore.

1057
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,400
你竟然叫我"小子"
You call me "Boy!"

1058
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,800
我会代表克里
I will unfurl

1059
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:07,120
对千年来山达尔的所作所为进行审判
1,000 years of Kree justice on Xandar,

1060
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,800
让它消失殆尽
and burn it to its core!

1061
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,920
之后  灭霸
Then, Thanos,

1062
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,040
我就去找你算账
I am coming for you.

1063
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,320
毁灭山达尔之后  你会杀掉我父亲吗
After Xandar, you are going to kill my father?

1064
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,640
你想反抗我吗
You dare to oppose me?

1065
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,690
你也看到他对我做了些什么
You see what he has turned me into.

1066
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:28,960
你杀了他  我会再帮你毁灭一千个星球
If you kill him, I will help you destroy a thousand planets.

1067
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,280
你敢背叛我?
You betray me?

1068
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,200
偷我的钱?
Steal my money?

1069
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,920
住手  放开他
Stop it! Leave him alone!

1070
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,400
你小时候刚被我捡到的时候
When I picked you up as a kid,

1071
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,880
这些小子想吃了你
these boys wanted to eat you.

1072
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,480
他们还没尝过地星人的味道呢
They ain't never tasted Terran before.

1073
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,410
是我救了你
I saved your life!

1074
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,590
还有完没完啊  天哪
Will you shut up about that? God!

1075
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,130
二十年了  一直给我说这些陈芝麻烂谷子
Twenty years, you been throwing that in my face,

1076
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,930
好像没有吃掉我是件多么伟大的事
like it's some great thing, not eating me.

1077
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:55,520
正常人哪会每天想着吃人啊
Normal people don't even think about eating someone else!

1078
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,160
不吃我难道我还得谢你吗
Much less that person having to be grateful for it!

1079
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,960
是你劫持了我
You abducted me, man.

1080
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,720
把我从家里掳走  害我无亲无故
You stole me from my home and from my family.

1081
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,000
你他妈才不是因为在乎你们地星
You don't give a damn about your Terra!

1082
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,520
你害怕
You're scared

1083
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,850
不过是因为内心太懦弱了
because you're soft in here.

1084
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:09,960
这里  就在这里
Here, right here!

1085
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,320
勇度
Yondu!

1086
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,770
听我说
Listen to me.

1087
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,040
罗南掌握着一块叫无限宝石的东西
Ronan has something called an Infinity Stone.

1088
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,960
我知道他手里有什么  小姑娘
I know what he's got, girl.

1089
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,440
那你就该知道  我们必须把它抢回来
Then you know we must get it back!

1090
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,000
他会用宝石摧毁掉山达尔
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

1091
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,550
我们得警告他们
We have to warn them.

1092
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:26,250
否则无数的人会因此丧命
Billions of people will perish.

1093
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,970
她就是这样给你洗脑的吗  小子
Is that what she's been filling your head with, boy?

1094
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,120
多愁善感
Sentiment?

1095
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:33,490
蛆虫一样蚕食掉你的大脑
Eating away your brain like maggots!

1096
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,490
就这样吧
That's it.

1097
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,200
不
No!

1098
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:42,760
抱歉了  小子
Sorry, boy.

1099
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,710
身为队长  必须杀一儆百
But a captain's gotta teach his men

1100
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:46,440
让手下知道背叛会是什么下场
what happens to those what cross him.

1101
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,200
队长要以身作则
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

1102
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,920
如果你现在杀了我
If you kill me now,

1103
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:57,210
就别想做成这辈子最大一笔生意了
you are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen.

1104
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,770
无限宝石吗
The Stone?

1105
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,480
你最好能想出个别的
I hope you got something better than that.

1106
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,290
没有人能从罗南手里偷东西
Because ain't nobody stealing from Ronan.

1107
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,770
我们有秘密武器
We got a ringer.

1108
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,370
是吗
Is that right?

1109
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,880
她清楚有关罗南的一切
She knows everything there is to know about Ronan.

1110
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,280
他的舰队
His ships,

1111
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,010
他的部下
his army.

1112
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,000
他也有弱点
He's vulnerable.

1113
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,170
你觉得怎么样  勇度
Hey, what do you say, Yondu?

1114
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,760
我和你  还跟以前一样  携手作战
Me and you, taking down a mark side-by-side, like the old days.

1115
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:36,560
放开他
Let him go!

1116
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,800
你小子一向有种
You always did have a scrote, boy!

1117
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,730
所以我当时才留你在身边
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.

1118
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,960
队长  这种攻击不痛不痒的
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.

1119
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,320
请注意  蠢货们
Attention, idiots.

1120
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,200
飞船上这个疯子手里拿着的是强子枪
The lunatic on top of this craft is holding a Hadron Enforcer.

1121
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,080
我独家设计的武器
It's a weapon of my own design.

1122
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,360
这是在搞什么
What the hell?

1123
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,520
要是你们不赶紧交出我朋友
If you don't hand over our companions now,

1124
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,000
他就把你们的飞船轰出个新鲜的洞
he's gonna tear your ship a new one.

1125
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,920
又大又新鲜的洞
A very big new one!

1126
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,920
-老子才不买你的账  -我倒数五下
- I ain't buyin' it. - I'm giving you to the count of five.

1127
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,600
-5  4  3  -别  等一下
- 5, 4, 3... - No! Wait, hold on!

1128
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,520
火箭  是我  真是的
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

1129
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,680
已经谈拢了  我们没事了
We figured it out! We're fine!

1130
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,400
奎尔  怎么回事
Hey, Quill. What's going on?

1131
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,650
这就叫"谈拢了"
You call that "Figured it out"?

1132
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:29,830
要从那群把我们
We're gonna rob the guys

1133
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:31,240
打得屁滚尿流的家伙手里抢东西
who just beat us senseless.

1134
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,650
你还有脸说屁滚尿流
You want to talk about senseless?

1135
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:35,050
你到底是想救我们还是想把我们炸飞
How about trying to save us by blowing us up?

1136
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,750
他们要是不交出你们
We were only gonna blow you up

1137
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:37,970
我才会把他们炸飞
if they didn't turn you over!

1138
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,800
你只数五下
And how on earth were they gonna turn us over

1139
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,520
他们哪有时间交出我们
when you only gave them a count of five?

1140
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,960
我们又没空考虑倒数时间
We didn't have time to work out the minutiae

1141
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:45,170
那些细节
of the plan.

1142
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,570
我们为朋友两肋插刀就这下场
This is what we get for acting altruistically.

1143
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,680
-我是格鲁特  -他们根本不领情
- I am Groot. - They are ungrateful.

1144
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:50,960
重点是
What's important now

1145
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,770
我们说服了掠夺者军队
is we get the Ravagers' army

1146
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,170
帮我们拯救山达尔
to help us save Xandar.

1147
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,730
然后我们再把宝石交给勇度
So we can give the Stone to Yondu

1148
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,780
好让他卖给一个更邪恶的家伙吗
who's just gonna sell to somebody even worse?

1149
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:59,200
这个之后再议
We'll figure that part out later.

1150
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,010
我们必须阻止罗南
We have to stop Ronan.

1151
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,480
怎么阻止
How?

1152
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:03,770
我有个计划
I have a plan.

1153
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:04,800
你有个计划?
You've got a plan?

1154
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,320
没错
Yes.

1155
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:07,920
首先  那句话是我说的
First of all, you're copying me from

1156
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,450
-你算是抄袭  -哪有
- when I said I had a plan. - No, I'm not.

1157
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,860
这话谁都会说
People say that all the time.

1158
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:12,570
又没什么特别的
It's not that unique of a thing to say.

1159
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,440
其次  我不相信你有什么计划
Secondly, I don't even believe you have a plan.

1160
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,330
我有一部分计划
I have part of a plan!

1161
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,000
一部分是多少
What percentage of a plan do you have?

1162
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,570
鉴于你在无存知地的表现
You don't get to ask questions

1163
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,320
你没有权利提问
after the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.

1164
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,130
我可救了奎尔
I just saved Quill.

1165
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,210
我们已经讨论过了
We've already established

1166
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,080
你们想炸了我乘坐的飞船  那可不是在救我
that you destroying the ship that I'm on is not saving me.

1167
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,130
我们什么时候讨论过了
When did we establish it?

1168
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:29,160
就几秒钟以前
Like three seconds ago!

1169
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:31,400
我没在仔细听  那会儿正走神
I wasn't listening. I was thinking of something else.

1170
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,520
她说得没错  你没有发表意见的权利
She's right. You don't get an opinion.

1171
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,000
你有百分之多少的计划
What percentage?

1172
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,570
我不知道  百分之十二吧
I don't know. Twelve percent.

1173
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,010
百分之十二?
Twelve percent?

1174
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,080
你笑得真假
That's a fake laugh.

1175
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,050
-是真的  -太假了
- It's real! - Totally fake.

1176
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,340
这是我这辈子笑得最真实
That is the most real, authentic,

1177
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,680
最歇斯底里的一次了
hysterical laugh of my entire life

1178
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,190
因为你这是狗屁计划
because that is not a plan.

1179
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:50,450
只能算是一个想法
It's barely a concept.

1180
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,600
你站到他们那一边去了吗
You're taking their side?

1181
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:52,960
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1182
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,530
是比百分之十一要强点  又怎样
So what, it's better than 11%?

1183
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,130
你那狗屁计划能有什么用
What the hell does that have to do with anything?

1184
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,360
谢谢你  格鲁特  谢谢
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

1185
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,320
格鲁特是你们当中唯一一个明事理的
See? Groot's the only one of you who has a clue.

1186
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,360
伙伴们
Guys.

1187
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,280
拜托
Come on.

1188
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,530
勇度马上就要过来了
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.

1189
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,040
他还想听听我们的大计划呢
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.

1190
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,360
我需要你们的帮助
I need your help.

1191
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,400
看看我们
I look around at us.

1192
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:23,920
知道我看到了什么吗
You know what I see?

1193
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,320
一群失败者
Losers.

1194
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,130
我们就像
I mean, like,

1195
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,290
一群失魂落魄的家伙
folks who have lost stuff.

1196
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,480
确实如此  我们所有人都失去过
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.

1197
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,930
失去了家
Our homes,

1198
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,050
失去了家人
our families,

1199
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,080
失去了正常的生活
normal lives.

1200
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,980
没错  生活本来就是付出比回报更多
And, usually, life takes more than it gives.

1201
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:45,210
可今天不是
But not today.

1202
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,320
今天我们得到了眷顾
Today, it's given us something.

1203
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,050
生活给了我们一个机会
It has given us a chance.

1204
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,560
什么机会
To do what?

1205
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,760
去拼一回
To give a shit.

1206
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,320
仅此一回
For once.

1207
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,520
不要逃避
Not run away.

1208
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,890
罗南要屠杀无数无辜的生命
I, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch

1209
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,000
而我  绝不会袖手旁观
as Ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives.

1210
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,720
可是  奎尔  想要阻止罗南
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,

1211
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,840
是不可能的
it's impossible.

1212
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,640
你是在叫我们去送死
You're asking us to die.

1213
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,200
是啊  应该是吧
Yeah, I guess I am.

1214
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,160
奎尔
Quill.

1215
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,680
我活了这么久  只跟敌人打过交道
I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies.

1216
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:54,930
我愿意和朋友共生死
I will be grateful to die among my friends.

1217
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,380
你是个有担当的男人  奎尔
You are an honorable man, Quill.

1218
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,080
我愿意跟你并肩作战
I will fight beside you.

1219
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,800
最后
And in the end,

1220
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,800
我就能和我的妻女团聚了
I will see my wife and daughter again.

1221
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,920
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1222
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:34,480
随你们吧  反正本来我也活不长
What the hell. I don't got that long a lifespan, anyway.

1223
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,720
我也站起来了  你们满意了吧
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

1224
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,360
现在我们都站起来了
We're all standing up now.

1225
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,850
一群傻缺  站成个圈圈
Bunch of jackasses, standing in a circle.

1226
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,560
宝石会对任何有机体产生反应
The Stone reacts to anything organic.

1227
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:59,810
目标越大  威力越强
The bigger the target, the bigger the power surge.

1228
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,890
罗南只需要让宝石
All Ronan's got to do is

1229
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:03,000
接触到星球的表面  它就会毁掉一切
touch the Stone to the planet's surface and zap.

1230
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,810
所有的植物  动物
All plants, animals,

1231
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,720
-新星军团  -一切都将被毁灭
- Nova Corps. - Everything will die.

1232
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,040
所以不能让罗南登陆
So Ronan does not make the surface.

1233
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,960
火箭带领一队人马在暗黑星号右舷
Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole

1234
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:16,280
轰开一个洞
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.

1235
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:20,570
这样我们和勇度的飞船就可以攻进去了
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

1236
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,450
里面有上百个萨卡士兵把守吧
Won't there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?

1237
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:26,320
萨卡士兵都是纸做的
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

1238
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,640
他们一旦得知我们登陆了
Once they know we're on board,

1239
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,020
罗南会关上舱内的安全门
Ronan will isolate himself

1240
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:37,170
把自己隔离起来
behind impenetrable security doors on deck.

1241
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,640
我可以通过破坏动力系统解锁
Which I can disable by dismantling the power source.

1242
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,570
接着我们进到驾驶舱
We'll make it to the flight deck,

1243
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:45,020
用强子枪把罗南轰上天
and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan.

1244
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,240
罗南一死我们就回收宝石
Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the Stone.

1245
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,280
记得要把它装进这些装置里
Use these devices to contain it.

1246
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:54,990
别直接触摸
If you touch it,

1247
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,620
不然小命就没了
it will kill you.

1248
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,620
我会联络之前逮捕过我们的新星警官
I'll contact one of the Nova officers who arrested us.

1249
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:04,780
但愿他们相信我们是来帮忙的
Hopefully, they'll believe we're there to help.

1250
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:05,670
{\an8}正在呼入

1251
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:05,670
{\an8}彼得·奎尔

1252
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,240
完成计划还需要最后一步
There's one more thing we need to complete the plan.

1253
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,200
那家伙的眼睛
That guy's eye.

1254
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,590
不  瞎说什么呢
No! No, we don't.

1255
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:16,130
我们不需要那家伙的眼睛
No, we don't need that guy's eye.

1256
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:19,840
不  说真的  对我来说相当重要呢
No, seriously, I need it! It's important to me.

1257
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,250
已发现罗南舰队
Ronan's fleet has been spotted,

1258
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:29,280
预计十五分钟后抵达
and will arrive in T-minus fifteen minutes.

1259
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:31,050
听好了  小子
Remember, boy.

1260
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,360
这事完了之后
At the end of all this,

1261
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,950
宝石归我
I get the Stone.

1262
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:37,780
敢耍我就砍死你们
You cross me, we kill you all.

1263
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,370
准备大干一场吧  小子们
Let's go get 'em, boys!

1264
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:11,940
这计划烂死了
This is a terrible plan.

1265
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:14,720
不是你说要和朋友共生死的吗
Hey, you're the one who said you wanted to die among friends.

1266
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:20,990
新星至尊
Nova Prime.

1267
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:24,620
一个掠夺者刚刚给我传达了一则消息
I received a transmission from one of the Ravagers.

1268
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:27,880
他说罗南得到了一颗什么无限宝石
He says Ronan's in possession of something called an Infinity Stone

1269
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:29,370
正冲着山达尔来
and he's headed toward Xandar.

1270
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,250
老天爷
Good God.

1271
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,680
不过是个幌子  别忘了他是罪犯
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

1272
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,170
他有说我们为什么要相信他吗
Did he say why we should believe him?

1273
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,560
他说他们一帮人刚刚越狱
He said his crew just escaped from prison,

1274
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,730
如果不是为了拯救山达尔没理由冒险
so he'd have no other reason to risk coming to Xandar to help.

1275
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,140
他说他确实是个
He says that he's an...

1276
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:44,980
"混球"
"A-hole."

1277
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,360
但不是一个
But he's not...

1278
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,280
引用他原话就是
and I'm quoting him, here,

1279
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,600
"彻头彻尾的混蛋"
"100% a dick."

1280
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:52,270
你信他吗
Do you believe him?

1281
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:55,650
我也不知道有没有彻头彻尾的混蛋  夫人
I don't know that I believe anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am.

1282
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,800
我是问  你相信他是来帮忙的吗
I mean, do you believe that he is here to help?

1283
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,520
信啊
Yeah.

1284
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,090
不明舰队逼近中
A fleet approaches.

1285
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,120
看起来像是掠夺者
They appear to be Ravagers.

1286
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:29,400
开火
Fire!

1287
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,800
掩护就位
Cover it down.

1288
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,880
全体下潜
Submerge!

1289
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,380
火箭  快上
Rocket, hurry!

1290
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,770
全体飞行员下潜
All pilots, dive!

1291
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,080
他们在我们正下方
They're beneath us!

1292
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,330
疏散全体市民
Evacuate the city.

1293
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:20,960
我们的首要任务是确保人民安全撤离
Our priority is to get our people away from the battle.

1294
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,790
全速推进  动作快
Forward thrust, now!

1295
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:43,520
加把劲儿
Come on!

1296
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,840
奎尔  勇度  趁现在
Quill! Yondu! Now!

1297
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,650
妈的
Aw, hell!

1298
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,280
我被击落了  奎尔
I'm going down, Quill!

1299
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,160
别给我耍花招  小子
No more games with me, boy!

1300
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:16,920
完事之后我们再会
I'll see you at the end of this!

1301
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,300
他们人太多了  火箭
There are too many of them, Rocket!

1302
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,440
我们没法突围
We'll never make it up there!

1303
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,600
彼得·奎尔
Peter Quill.

1304
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,160
我是新星军团的丹纳利安·萨尔
This is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps.

1305
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,600
先声明一下  我始终认为不该相信你
For the record, I advised against trusting you here.

1306
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,120
看来我的"混蛋"消息他们收到了
They got my "Dick" Message!

1307
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,720
用事实证明我错了吧
Prove me wrong.

1308
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,080
爽
Yes!

1309
01:26:23,490 --> 01:26:24,650
够嗨
Yes!

1310
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,560
我们和凯文·贝肯差不多厉害吧
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

1311
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,410
右舷核心部位受创
The starboard kern has been breached!

1312
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:36,740
他们闯进来了
We have been boarded.

1313
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,170
继续向前推进
Continue our approach.

1314
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,600
但是新星军团也掺合进来了
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

1315
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,410
着陆之后一切就都不是问题了
None of that will matter once we reach the surface.

1316
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,520
关闭所有安全门
Seal security doors!

1317
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,850
赶紧
Now!

1318
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,010
别挡老娘的路
Get out of my way!

1319
01:26:59,730 --> 01:27:01,610
老天
Oh, man.

1320
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:03,360
所有新星飞行员听令
All Nova pilots,

1321
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:06,200
全体对接形成封锁网
interlock and form a blockade.

1322
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:10,120
务必阻止暗黑星号着陆
The Dark Aster must not reach the ground.

1323
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:23,840
已锁入
Locked in!

1324
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,840
已锁入
Locked in.

1325
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,400
已锁入
We're locked in.

1326
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,880
我什么都看不见
I can barely see.

1327
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,960
你什么时候学了这一招
When did you learn to do that?

1328
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,600
我猜答案肯定是
Pretty sure the answer is

1329
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,360
"我是格鲁特"
"I am Groot."

1330
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,040
飞行甲板就在前方300米处
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.

1331
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,920
我希望你们知道
I want you all to know that

1332
01:28:47,950 --> 01:28:49,690
感谢你们  不在意我的鲁莽之举
I am grateful for your acceptance

1333
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:50,730
依然接受我
after my blunders.

1334
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,400
再次有朋友相伴的感觉...
It is pleasing to once again have...

1335
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,040
真棒
friends.

1336
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:59,050
奎尔  你是我朋友
You, Quill, are my friend.

1337
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:00,280
谢了
Thanks.

1338
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:03,210
这颗蠢树也是我朋友
This dumb tree, he is my friend.

1339
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:05,920
还有这个绿婊子也
And this green whore, she, too...

1340
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,560
给我闭嘴
You must stop!

1341
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:13,200
卡魔拉  看看你干的好事
Gamora, look at what you have done.

1342
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,880
你还是一如既往的软弱
You have always been weak.

1343
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,280
愚蠢  背信弃...
You stupid, traitorous...

1344
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,760
不要这么跟我朋友说话
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

1345
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,000
你们去飞行甲板
Head to the flight deck.

1346
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:30,810
我去切断安全门的动力
I'll shut down the power to the security doors.

1347
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:40,600
勇度·尤冬塔
Yondu Udonta.

1348
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:44,810
命令自己的手下向新星军团投降
Order your men to turn on the Nova Corps.

1349
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,560
玩够了没  掠夺者
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

1350
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,520
你的死期到...
Time to die...

1351
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,870
星云  别这样
Nebula, please.

1352
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,460
够了  死灵舰队飞行员
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,

1353
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:58,010
开始自我献祭吧
enact immolation initiative.

1354
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,850
他们冲下去轰炸城市了
They're dive-bombing the city!

1355
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,680
丹纳利安·萨尔  需要解除连锁吗
Denarian Saal, should we break formation?

1356
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,490
不行  保持阵形
No! Hold your positions.

1357
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:39,510
拖住罗南  萨尔
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

1358
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:41,370
下面市民的安全交给我们了
We'll take care of the people down here.

1359
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,600
我居然要听命于一只小仓鼠
I can't believe I'm taking orders from a hamster.

1360
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,350
星爵
Star-Lord.

1361
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:49,690
终于记住了
Finally.

1362
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:01,480
你个卑鄙的贼
You thief!

1363
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:16,200
你们休想攻到罗南那儿去
You will never make it to Ronan.

1364
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,200
在死灵舰着陆之前就把他们轰下来
Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground.

1365
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,200
来吧
Come on!

1366
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:20,520
手指划过喉咙就是杀人
Finger to the throat means death.

1367
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,770
我用比喻了
Metaphor.

1368
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,200
差不多吧
Yeah, sorta.

1369
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:30,520
不是吧
Oh, no.

1370
01:33:58,520 --> 01:33:59,930
山达尔
Xandar!

1371
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:03,250
接受制裁吧
You stand accused.

1372
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:08,370
可悲的和平条约也救不了你们了
Your wretched peace treaty will not save you now.

1373
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:12,580
跟条约一起葬身火海吧
It is the tinder on which you burn.

1374
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:37,760
火箭
Rocket!

1375
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,720
坚持住  萨尔  再坚...
Hold on, Saal, just...

1376
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:07,680
奎尔  你得快点了
Quill, you gotta hurry.

1377
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,530
市民倒是都被疏散了
The city's been evacuated,

1378
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,890
可我们还在苦战呢
but we're getting our asses kicked down here.

1379
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,680
卡魔拉还没把门打开
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

1380
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:39,960
星云
Nebula!

1381
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:43,800
妹妹  帮我们一起打败罗南吧
Sister, help us fight Ronan.

1382
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,460
你很清楚他就是个疯子
You know he's crazy.

1383
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,470
你们俩都是疯子
I know you're both crazy.

1384
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:49,000
不
No!

1385
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:52,300
什么鬼...
What the...?

1386
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:54,890
滚出去
Get out!

1387
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:38,390
你成功了
You did it!

1388
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:05,970
之前我错了
I was mistaken.

1389
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,090
我确实记得你家人
I do remember your family.

1390
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:09,960
她们临死时的叫声
Their screams were

1391
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:12,240
那么可悲  我
pitiful. I...

1392
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,480
不  格鲁特
No, Groot!

1393
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:12,250
别这样
You can't.

1394
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:13,770
你会死的
You'll die.

1395
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,160
为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?

1396
01:39:16,510 --> 01:39:17,430
为什么
Why?

1397
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,180
我们
We...

1398
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:27,600
是
are...

1399
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:30,190
格鲁特
Groot.

1400
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:36,000
真是个白痴
I called him an idiot.

1401
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,640
是你杀了格鲁特
You killed Groot!

1402
01:41:04,450 --> 01:41:06,130
看吧
Behold!

1403
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,330
看这支银河护卫队
Your guardians of the galaxy.

1404
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:12,960
你们护卫了什么
What fruit have they wrought?

1405
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:17,290
现在我终于得偿所愿
Only that my father and his father

1406
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:20,880
为我父亲和爷爷报了仇
shall finally know vengeance.

1407
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,280
山达尔的子民
People of Xandar,

1408
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:27,260
背弃你们卑微的信仰
the time has come to rejoice

1409
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:31,300
迎接我的时刻到了
and renounce your paltry gods!

1410
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:35,440
你们即将得到救赎
Your salvation is at hand.

1411
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:49,200
听这几句
Listen to these words.

1412
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:00,050
用力舞起来
Now bring it down hard!

1413
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:04,680
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

1414
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:07,770
比舞啊  老兄  就我们俩
Dance-off, Bro. Me and you.

1415
01:42:11,310 --> 01:42:12,060
卡魔拉
Gamora.

1416
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:15,190
委婉拒绝  收回邀请
Subtle. Take it back.

1417
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:18,360
你到底在搞什么鬼
What are you doing?

1418
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:21,050
分你的心啊  大蠢蛋
I'm distracting you, you big turd blossom.

1419
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:38,730
不
No!

1420
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:17,000
彼得  握住我的手
Peter! Take my hand!

1421
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:23,210
握住我的手  彼得
Take my hand, Peter.

1422
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:25,300
妈妈
Mom.

1423
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:28,640
握住我的手
Take my hand!

1424
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:23,940
你们只是凡人
You're mortal!

1425
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:25,900
怎么可能
How?

1426
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:28,450
你不是说过吗  婊子
You said it yourself, bitch.

1427
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,890
我们可是银河护卫队
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1428
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:02,190
不错  不错
Well, well, well.

1429
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:04,480
好一场光影盛宴
Quite the light show.

1430
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,900
大团圆结局啊
Ain't this sweet.

1431
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,320
不过在你们嘿咻嘿咻之前
But you got some business to attend to

1432
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:14,160
先给我把正事办了
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

1433
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:18,040
彼得  你不能给他
Peter, you can't. Peter.

1434
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:20,240
你得三思  勇度
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu.

1435
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:22,210
我不知道你要把它卖给谁
I don't know who you're selling this to,

1436
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:24,250
不过能让宇宙安定平稳的唯一方法
but the only way the universe can survive

1437
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:26,670
就是把它交给新星军团保管
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.

1438
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,760
都说我长得像菩萨
I may be as pretty as an angel,

1439
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:33,760
可我没有菩萨心肠
but I sure as hell ain't one.

1440
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,680
快交给我吧  孩子
Hand it over, son.

1441
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:54,360
勇度
Yondu.

1442
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:01,330
决不能打开宇宙灵球  你知道的吧
Do not open that Orb. You know that, right?

1443
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:03,800
你也看见它的威力了
You've seen what it does to people.

1444
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,800
奎尔这小子还挺懂事
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

1445
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:19,930
当初没有按他爹的要求把他送过去
It's probably good we didn't deliver him to his dad

1446
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:21,400
也许是个正确的决定
like we was hired to do.

1447
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,250
是啊  他爹就是个混球
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

1448
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:31,110
等他发现宇宙灵球被我掉包了
He is gonna be so pissed when he realizes

1449
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:32,730
非气炸不可
I switched out the Orb on him.

1450
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:37,530
他一定会砍死你  彼得
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

1451
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,160
是啊
Oh, I know.

1452
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:44,460
不过他也算是我唯一的亲人了
But he was about the only family I had.

1453
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:47,600
不
No.

1454
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,080
不止是他
He wasn't.

1455
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:39,890
你们怎么连这个都知道
Why would you even know this?

1456
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:40,900
当初抓你回来后
When we arrested you,

1457
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:42,810
我们发现你的神经系统有些异常
we noticed an anomaly in your nervous system,

1458
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:44,520
于是帮你做了检查
so we had it checked out.

1459
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:47,230
所以我不是地星人
I'm not Terran?

1460
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:48,840
有一半血统来自地星
You are half Terran.

1461
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,640
你母亲是地球人  至于你父亲
Your mother was of Earth. Your father, well,

1462
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:56,360
他是某种我们从未接触过的远古生灵
he's something very ancient we've never seen here before.

1463
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:57,400
怪不得
That could be why

1464
01:47:57,430 --> 01:48:00,240
你握着宝石那么久却没事
you were able to hold the Stone for as long as you did.

1465
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:03,200
你的朋友们来齐了
Your friends have arrived.

1466
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:06,080
我谨代表新星军团
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

1467
01:48:06,790 --> 01:48:10,040
向你们致以最真诚的谢意
we'd like to express our profound gratitude

1468
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:12,880
谢谢你们拯救了山达尔
for your help in saving Xandar.

1469
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:16,510
你们可以跟随丹纳利安·戴
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

1470
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:18,160
他有东西要带你们看
he has something to show you.

1471
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:19,630
谢谢了  新星至尊
Thank you, Nova Prime.

1472
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:31,060
你帮妻女报了仇
Your wife and child shall rest well

1473
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:33,400
现在她们能安息了
knowing that you have avenged them.

1474
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:34,840
是啊
Yes.

1475
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,920
不过说到底罗南只是个傀儡
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

1476
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:40,200
得杀掉灭霸才算报仇
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

1477
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:45,280
我们想保留它原本的样子
We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible.

1478
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:47,840
已经尽全力做了相关修复了
We salvaged as much as we could.

1479
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:51,960
我
I...

1480
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:55,080
多谢了
Thank you.

1481
01:48:56,710 --> 01:48:58,210
我也有妻儿
I have a family.

1482
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,630
多亏你她们才能活下来
They're alive because of you.

1483
01:49:04,550 --> 01:49:07,350
你们的犯罪记录已经被抹掉了
Your criminal records have also been expunged.

1484
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:08,520
不过还是得提醒你们
However, I have to warn

1485
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:11,480
遵纪守法才是好公民
you against breaking any laws in the future.

1486
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:12,730
问一下
Question.

1487
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:14,440
如果我拿了一件很想要的
What if I see something that I want to take,

1488
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:15,850
刚好又属于别人的东西呢
and it belongs to someone else?

1489
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,210
你会被逮捕
You will be arrested.

1490
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:19,480
可如果我比物主更想要那东西呢
But what if I want it more than the person who has it?

1491
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:21,780
-还是违法的  -说不通啊
- It's still illegal. - That doesn't follow.

1492
01:49:21,820 --> 01:49:23,660
我更想要啊  长官  你懂吗
No, I want it more, sir. Do you understand?

1493
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:24,620
笑什么
What are you laughing at?

1494
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:26,610
干嘛拉我走  我不能和这位先生聊聊吗
Why? I can't have a discussion with this gentleman?

1495
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:28,480
如果谁把我惹毛了
What if someone does something irksome

1496
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:31,000
然后我决定要抽了他的脊椎呢
and I decide to remove his spine?

1497
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:33,480
那个
That's...

1498
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:37,380
那个应该算谋杀了
That's actually murder.

1499
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:41,170
最恶劣的犯罪之一
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

1500
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:44,160
所以  也是违法的
So... also illegal.

1501
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,390
他们会老实待着的  戴
They'll be fine, Dey.

1502
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:50,810
我会看好他们的
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

1503
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:51,840
你
You?

1504
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:57,690
对啊  我
Yeah. Me.

1505

彼得
Peter,

1506
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:22,880
我知道最近几个月对你来说很痛苦
I know these last few months have been hard for you.

1507
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,570
其实我只是要去个更好的地方
But I'm going to a better place.

1508
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:29,200
我会照顾好自己的
And I will be okay.

1509
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:33,080
我会永远陪在你身边
And I will always be with you.

1510
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,480
你是我生命的曙光
You are the light of my life.

1511
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:39,880
我挚爱的儿子
My precious son.

1512

我的小星爵
My little Star-Lord.

1513
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:46,480
永远爱你的妈妈
Love, Mom.

So, what should we do next?

1516
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:50,740
干点好事
Something good?

干点坏事
Something bad?

还是都干一点
A bit of both?

你说了算  星爵
We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.
